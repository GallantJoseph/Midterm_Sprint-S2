          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to The Code Brew Caf&eacute;, we decided to combine our love for coffee with the need for a
            little break. We've all been there lost in the hustle of work, life,
            or whatever it is that keeps us busy. Sometimes, we just need a
            moment to breathe, slow down, and recharge. Thats exactly why we
            opened this place. We built The Code Brew Caf&eacute; as a cozy
            retreat, not just for coders, but for anyone who needs to step away
            from the chaos of daily life. Whether you're buried in work,
            studying for exams, or just feeling the weight of the world, our
            caf&eacute; is here for you to take a breather. Inspired by the
            beauty of Newfoundland and the warmth of its people, we've created a
            space that feels like home. From our carefully brewed coffees to our
            laid-back vibe, we want you to relax and enjoy the simple things. At
            The Code Brew Caf&eacute;, we're all about community. So, come in,
            grab your favourite brew, and let the world slow down for a bit.
            Whether you're here to work, chat, or just take a pause from the
            busyness of life, we're here to help you find your moment of calm.
