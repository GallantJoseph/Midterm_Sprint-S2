          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to The Code Brew Cafe, where three Newfoundland coders
            decided to combine our love for coffee with the need for a little
            break. We've all been there lost in the hustle of work, life, or
            whatever it is that keeps us busy. Sometimes, we just need a moment
            to breathe, slow down, and recharge. Thats exactly why we opened
            this place. We built The Code Brew Cafe as a cozy retreat, not just
            for coders, but for anyone who needs to step away from the chaos of
            daily life. Whether you're buried in work, studying for exams, or
            just feeling the weight of the world, our cafe is here for you to
            take a breather. Inspired by the beauty of Newfoundland and the
            warmth of its people, we've created a space that feels like home.
            From our carefully brewed coffees to our laid-back vibe, we want you
            to relax and enjoy the simple things. At The Code Brew Cafe, we're
            all about community. So, come in, grab your favourite brew, and let
            the world slow down for a bit. Whether you're here to work, chat, or
            just take a pause from the busyness of life, we're here to help you
            find your moment of calm.
